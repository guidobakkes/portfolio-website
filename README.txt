Portfolio Website Project
=========================

This is my first try at building a website from the ground up. Bear with me here.
It was created as an exercise for FreeCodeCamp.com.

In this project I will, over time, continuously try to add new things and implement new techniques I've come across. For now, I have yet to register a domain name and get hosting, but in the future I will probably upload this website and use it as an actual portfolio.
